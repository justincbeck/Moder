What if it could also decode an audio stream?
What if it could also convert text into a morse code audio stream (for a ring tone)?

Adding a game:

The game consists of a letter appearing on screen and a user trying to tap
out the letter in morese code.  Getting the letter right gets some points.

There will be some number of tries before the letter is revealed in Morse
code.

Levels increasing will present letters in pairs, sets of three, of four and
then whole words.

Also, the levels could present the letters/words for shorter
times or allow less tries before counting the 'guess' as wrong.
